> So many talented artists out there but the society don’t appreciate their talents. I have seen great talents wasted and government imposed heavy tax to those trying to earn a living. I want to enlighten and educate them on nft and web3 space.

We believe artists deserves more recognition and their art need to be appreciated. We want to guide creative minds on how to benefit from their creativity. I’m also working on building a gallery, exhibition center and digital library in the metaverse that will help create more awareness for our holders when we launch. \
